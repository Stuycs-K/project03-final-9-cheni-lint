# Dev Log:

## Tracey

### 2024-01-02 - pair up with partner
i asked ivan, he said yes, took about 5 seconds

### 2024-01-03 - discuss what project we want to make and make proposal
heavily debated what we want to do and after multiple tries we settled with client server network that uses
a terminal to communicate and allows for the access and transfer of data, took about 2 hours

### 2024-01-04 - start working on server client network
i started doing the client server, basically just copy and pasting lab16 and k code

### 2024-01-05 - research how to connect with multiple client using select
figure out that you need multiple thread, fork, or select in order to do multiple client connection and just reading
up on code to understand select more

### 2024-01-06 - did testing
try to see why it wouldn't connect to client on the school laptop and turns out I forgot to do args and that wasted
a stupid amount of time (1.5 hrs)

### 2024-01-07 - did testing + research how to use select to decide which client to listen to
look at codes online and read documentations on it (.5 hrs)

### 2024-01-08 - tried implementing select listen
